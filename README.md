##Introduction
This is a word game called Shi-ri-to-ri in Japanese. It is intended for seniors and young children to have fun and exercise their brains at the same time.
Although it is a word game, the players will see only photos. The game is simple but still promotes cognitive activities.

##How to play
Place the animal names in such an order that the name starts with the last letter of the previous animal name.
For example, if the previous animal is a "panda", the next will be an animal that starts with "a" such as an "alligator".
It is simple, but you will see only animal photos, not their names.

There are 5 levels and 3 patterns each. You have 243 ways of completing the game. The instruction page can be opened from the home page and left it open during the play.
